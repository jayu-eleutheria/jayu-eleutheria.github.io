<h2 id="about-me">About me</h2>
<div>
<picture><img style="float: right; padding-left: 10px; max-width: 50%;" src="/assets/pictures/myself/about/about1.png"></img></picture>
<div><p>I’m <strong>Jayu Eleuthéria</strong>—or <strong>Jayu</strong> for short. You may use <em>she/her</em> to refer to me.</p>

<p>I’m currently a psychology undergraduate at Universidade Federal de Campina Grande. I intend on becoming a practicing psychoanalyst soon.</p>

<p>I learn and make other things on the side. Art is a lifelong hobby; I’m also a translator. I’m one of the founding members of <a href="https://zeroaesquerda.com.br">Zero à Esquerda</a>, a Brazilian leftist online publication that began its life as a translation collective. I enjoy worldbuilding and I'm slowly crafting a few stories that one day shall see the light of the day.</p>

<p>I'd like to learn how to sing, compose and play an instrument one day. I'm starting with the bass.<p/>

<p>My interests are fickle. Better to deduce them from <a href="/now/">what I’m currently engaged with</a> or through what I post around the internet.</p></div></div>
