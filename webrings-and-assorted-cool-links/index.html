<p>These are webrings I've joined:</p>

<p>Some of us miss the messy old days of the Internet where we tried to get along and we&#39;d link to each other&#39;s sites and it was all so much fun.</p>

<li><a href="https://hotlinewebring.club/">Hotline Webring</a><blockquote>
<p>Do you long for a simpler time, when America was Online and the only person you could Ask was Jeeves? Hotline Webring is bringing that time back, with Webrings!
In the 90s, search engines were of generally low quality, and people wanted a way to discover related sites. “I wish I could see more sites about puppies,” you might say to yourself over the sonorous clang of your modem, while waiting for a bitmap of a Clumber Spaniel to load.
So people with websites joined webrings, which were collections of sites where each site linked to their neighbors to form a ring. Sometimes there was one button on each site that&#39;d take you to a random site in the webring. People got more traffic and less-popular sites benefited from being linked to more-popular ones.
Now, in 2022 C.E., there are search engines and aggregators so finding related sites isn&#39;t that hard, and webrings have fallen by the wayside.
We here at Hotline Webring traveled to the wayside, picked up The Concept of a Webring, dusted it off, and launched it to frankly astonishing acclaim.</p>
