<p>Christmas is already gone, the year is almost done. No songs for the pleasures to come or for the delights at hand—the endless dream is sung as done and gone. "Everything had happened, though we didn't know it yet."</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/videoseries?si=JGodjBuKAeG8otpS&amp;list=PLXhecLqGdBAUTtJcWzz51ETlGki3gY1Df" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>戦慄の口づけの後、私はすこしだけ微笑む、horror turns into a numb smile and melancholic drone. However, <a href="http://k-punk.org/nihil-rebound-joy-division/">we're still not fully into no man's land</a>—there is a content to the curse: the ones who left us behind. Memory creates heaven.</p>
<p>And heaven is a small, comfy venue; an out-of-tune yet honest seraph sings, ophanim complementing her lament with movement and dynamics. This is a cursed world, but one that shall be subjugated.</p>
<p>呪われたこの地をやがて太陽よりも<br>
眩しい光が<br>
闇を引き裂き闇を従えて<br>
内なる声が結ばれる</p>
<p>Tuneless but far from emotionless, her voice prepares for reunion. Drone shall be succeeded by solos, lament by melancholic affirmation and celebration. Beauty in sadness, flowers grown for the end.</p>
<p>We're asked not to grieve. But what assurance of the light piercing through the land we have other than the stage lights? We must picture (or inscribe, or sing, or speak, or play) beauty. And yet, we <em>will</em> be deprived of the light. Only the memories which curse us with specters of reconciliation and reunion shall remain.</p>
<hr>
<p>Shizuka's work culminates here: from the combo of tuneless lament and jangle drone to the melancholic-yet-exhilarating instrumental sections, one gets a taste of everything they've done before in a single, coherent stage. Almost all previous atmospheres and textures can be found here: noise soundscapes, dreamlands, off-kilt lullabies, droning dirges, and celebratory solos.</p>
<p>Miura Shizuka delivers one of her best performances here: simultaneously stalwart and fragile, bigger than life and intimate, droning and heartfelt.</p>
<p>We are prepared for reckoning, reunion, reconciliation—only to be confronted by a bare-bones final piece and Shizuka's unceremonious goodbye. Miura Shizuka barely bows to the audience and quickly returns to the backstage. Soon, Maki also disappears.</p>
