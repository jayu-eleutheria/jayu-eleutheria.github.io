</code></pre><p>This is a <strong><a href="https://nownownow.com/about">Now page</a></strong>. I use it to share what I&#39;m currently doing, feeling, and thinking about. <a href="https://sive.rs/">Derek Sivers</a> started <a href="https://sive.rs/nowff">this trend</a>.</p>
<h2 id="now-as-of-2022-10-30">Now, as of 2022-10-30</h2>
<p>I&#39;m (still) building this site. I&#39;ve also started a small site for <a href="https://dreamjourney.neocities.org">a project involving Yume Nikki fangames</a>. I&#39;ve wanted to create it for a while now, and I&#39;m glad to be finally starting it.</p>
<p>Moving my handwritten notes to TiddlyWiki has been a pain in the ass, but when I&#39;m finished, I&#39;ll be glad I did it. My personal knowledge base shall be made public and uploaded to this site by the end of the current year. My undergraduate research has been finished; my thesis is on hold, just like my internship. My mental health hasn&#39;t been going well lately, and I gave myself a respite from a few academic activities. I&#39;ve returned to therapy—psychoanalysis, as one would expect me to. On another positive note, I&#39;ve become a student tutor for the second time, and it awarded me a grant for the next 9-ish months.</p>
<p>I finished reading The Silmarillion (it was even better than I expected), and I&#39;m currently around 50% of Patrick Rothfuss&#39; <em>The Name of the Wind</em>. I&#39;m enjoying it so far.</p>
