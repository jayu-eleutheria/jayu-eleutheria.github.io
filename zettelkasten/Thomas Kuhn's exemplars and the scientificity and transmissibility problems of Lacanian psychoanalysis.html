<p><a href="Thomas Kuhn.html">Thomas Kuhn</a> posits <a href="Exemplar (Kuhn).html">exemplars</a> as both the resource future scientists receive to internalize <a href="Scientific practice.html">scientific practice</a> and as a source of <a href="Puzzle-solving (Kuhn).html">puzzle-solving</a> far more related to <a href="Tacit knowledge (Michael Polanyi).html">tacit knowledge</a> than to the <a href="Rule (Kuhn).html">stated rules of scientific practice</a> themselves. Exemplars are as such a necessary feature of <a href="Normal science (Kuhn).html">normal science</a>: in a sense, they assure the permanence and reproduction of a <a href="Paradigm (Kuhn).html">paradigm</a> by allowing a would-be scientist to learn how to solve <a href="Puzzle (Kuhn).html">puzzles</a>, even in situations in which rules are not available or are of no help in maintaining a paradigm&#39;s hegemony. In conclusion, exemplars are one of the pillars of <a href="Science.html">science&#39;s</a> <a href="Transmissibility.html">transmissibility</a>.</p>
<p>Exemplars allow for <a href="Prediction (Science).html">prediction</a> not of a phenomena, but of the <a href="Scientific method.html">methodology</a> required to tackle one. They do so by assuring (and, if used, actually demonstrating) a would-be scientist that by repeating or inspiring oneself in how that exemplar was achieved, they can acquire sufficient know-how of the <a href="Puzzle rule (Kuhn).html">rules of the game</a> to tackle puzzles. Likewise, exemplars also allow for a kind of negative prediction based upon <a href="Specificity (Math).html">specificity</a> essential to <a href="Scientific revolution (Kuhn).html">paradigm change</a>: if an exemplar does not induce both explicit and tacit knowledge of the problem at hand, then one may have not a puzzle at hand, but an <a href="Abnormality (Kuhn).html">abnormality</a>.</p>
<p>The failure to allow for negative prediction when it is required to do so is at the center of the problems surrounding <a href="Lacanian psychoanalysis.html">Lacanian psychoanalysis</a>, its <a href="Scientificity.html">scientific status</a>, and its transmissibility.</p>
<p>When <a href="Jacques Lacan.html">Jacques Lacan</a> states than <a href="L'analyste ne s'autorise que de lui-même (Lacan).html">an analyst authorizes themself</a>, one is confronted with a belated surprise that reveals itself in three steps. At first glance, such sentence has all the qualities of <a href="Pseudoscience.html">pseudoscientificity</a> and <a href="Charlatanism.html">charlatanism</a>. However, when put into context, the aphorism loses its negative qualities: it is simply a consequence of the tautology that the true requirement for being a practitioner of something is to actually <em>practice</em> it. A scientist is someone who <a href="Scientific practice.html">practices science</a>; a <a href="Psychoanalyst.html">psychoanalyst</a> is someone who practices <a href="Analysis (Psychoanalysis.html">analysis</a>. A scientist learns and applies rules, <a href="Theory (Science).html">theory</a>, methodology, exemplars and anything else that may help them become proficient at scientific practice; an analyst learns and applies the <a href="Twin rules (Psychoanalysis).html">twin rules</a>, <a href="Psychoanalytic theory.html">psychoanalytical theory</a>, undergoes <a href="Didactic analysis (Psychoanalysis).html">didactic analysis</a>, and dabbles with anything else that may help them become proficient at analysis.</p>
<p>Let us assume (as the following assertions are not self-evident at all) that the concepts of paradigm and exemplars describe successfully elements of psychoanalysis in a sense closer to Thomas Kuhn&#39;s formulation of such concepts than to the ones in, for example, <a href="Art historiography.html">art historiography</a> that inspired him (such as <a href="School (Art).html">school</a> and <a href="Style (Art).html">style</a>).</p>
<p>Authors and groups such as <a href="Sigmund Freud.html">Sigmund Freud</a>, <a href="Melanie Klein.html">Melanie Klein</a>, the <a href="Frankfurt School.html">Frankfurt School</a>, and <a href="Jacques Lacan.html">Jacques Lacan</a> can then be said as having helped to found paradigms, and exemplars were thus produced both by such paradigm changes and by work done during normality periods.</p>
<p>However, asserting the existence of exemplars in psychoanalysis proves itself to be a more difficult task. For once, most of the (tentative) <a href="Evidence (Science).html">evidential content</a> of psychoanalysis consists of <a href="Case report (Science).html">case reports</a>. They permit a degree of <a href="Generalization (Science).html">generalization</a> lower than that of actual exemplars, which can be reproduced in a stronger sense than a case report can. Exemplars can be evidences themselves, but they may also be <em>based</em> upon existing evidence; psychoanalytic case reports can seldom be anything other than the first case. The <a href="Degree oc certainty.html">degree of certainty</a> of <a href="Specificity (Science).html">specificity</a> is also illusorily higher for Lacanian psychoanalytic practice, as such properties of case reports conjugate themselves with certain theoretical commitments to undermine the ability of Lacanian psychoanalysis to discriminate between <a href="Types of test results (Science).html">true and false positives and negatives</a>.</p>
<p>We find here our belated surprise: by taking Jacques Lacan&#39;s assertions about <a href="La science (Lacan).html">science</a>, <a href="L'éthique de la psychanalyse (Lacan).html">psychoanalysis&#39; ethics</a>, and <a href="Le discours de la science (Lacan).html">scientific ideologies</a> at face value, and, as <a href="Paulo Beer.html">Paulo Beer</a> affirms, having a dated conception of science, Lacanians can find justification for not producing more substantive evidences than the existing ones. This may hamper the production of exemplars, as they lose part of their possible <a href="Reproducibility (Science).html">reproducibility</a>.</p>
<p>Part, but not all of it: it can still be argued that with the usage of <a href="Free association (Psychoanalysis).html">free association</a> and <a href="Evenly-suspended attention (Psychoanalysis).html">evenly-suspended attention</a>, alongside other psychoanalytic tools, certain psychoanalysis&#39;s assertions can be said to have been reproduced if they lead to a <a href="Cure (Clinic).html">cure</a>. Certain, though not all of them: only the ones pertaining to <a href="Efficacy (Clinic).html">efficacy</a>, and not those pertaining to <a href="Validity (Science).html">validity</a>, can be said to have been reproduced. We still lack exemplars for psychoanalytic theory irrespective of <a href="Psychoanalysis' efficacy (Clinic).html">psychoanalysis&#39; efficacy</a>. The lack of sufficiently generalizable evidence for psychoanalytic theory hampers its transmissibility, as affirmed by Erikson Kaszubowski; such hampering translates itself as an undermining of reproducibility.</p>
<p>These problems pertain to a <a href="Scientific reconstruction of psychoanalysis.html">scientific reconstruction of psychoanalysis</a>, as they direct one towards which elements exactly impede a successful (be its result affirmative or negative) <a href="Validation of psychoanalytic theory.html">validation of psychoanalysis</a>. They also lend themselves to pinpointing specific problems in Lacanian psychoanalysis, such as the <a href="Singularity as valid object and as ideology in Lacanian psychoanalysis.html">dilemma of singularity</a>, the <a href="Impasses of la passe (Lacanian psychoanalysis).html">impasses of the passe</a>, and the <a href="Formalization difficulties (Lacanian psychoanalysis).html">difficulties of formalizing such strand of psychoanalysis</a>. <a href="Classic psychoanalysis.html">Classic psychoanalysis</a> is not immune to such critique either.</p>
